Now after creating the user page, we need to show the data of the user in the user page
to do this we will firt fetch the data of the user from the firestore

This will happen in user page only

modular based approach in newer versions of firebase

get all the data of the user using the where clause 

getting loading and user from useAuthState(Auth);

using this loading to avoid error and useEffect on loading

using CircularProgress to show while the data is being fetched and loading is true
