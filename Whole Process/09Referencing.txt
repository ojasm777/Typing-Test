In javaScript we used to use DOM querySelector and getElementById and all to reference to an element 
but here in react we can use Ref to refere to an element

Every HTML tag or element has this inbuilt property known as ref 
using this ref attribute we can pass a variable
<h1 ref = {a} ></h1>
now this a variable will be pointing to this h1 tag, it will have each and every property 
of this h1 tag, this is known as referencing 


useRef returns an object {current : null / a, ...}
