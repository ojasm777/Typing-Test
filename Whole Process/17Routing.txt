For routing we will use react-router-dom

we just have to tell that at what particular url what particular page should be loaded
 
Define routes in a component named Route (previously known as switches)

<Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Page />} />
</Routes>


Now when we click on the account circle we should be redirected to the /user page
