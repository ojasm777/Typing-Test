Typing speed formula

gross wpm = (all typed entries or char) / (5*time in minutes)

if correct incorrect taken in consideration then


net wpm = gross wpm - (uncorrected errors/time) 

accuracy = correct words typed / total words typed * 100%

correct chars / incorrect chars / missed chars / extra chars 
calculate all these after the test has ended
